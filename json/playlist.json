Sometime in the 70's my father recorded some of my grandfather's favorite songs from the album onto a single cassette tape so that my grandfather could listen to the album in his car. Almost fifty years later (after my grandfather died and the LPs were lost), I found the tapes in an old shoebox in my father's closet and recorded the songs again, this time from cassette into digital audio file. Although many of the songs on the tape have been forgotten, they live on now as digital files, covered in an unreal veneer of digital and analog decay.</p>",
